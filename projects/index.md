### 🤖 Robinhood - Amazon Alexa Skill (June 2017)

For my 2nd Amazon Alexa skill, I created an Alexa skill that leveraged the unofficial Robinhood API (https://github.com/sanko/Robinhood/) to allow users of Robinhood to get account updates such as their news and their account performance for the day. The skill also allows users to fetch quotes for any stock.
